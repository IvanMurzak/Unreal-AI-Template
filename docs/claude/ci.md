# CI

CI ships as `*.yml-sample` and is activated by `commands/init`. It mirrors the Unity extension CI,
adapted to Unreal: a reusable per-UE-version test workflow, a PR aggregator, a version-gated atomic
release, and a manual bump workflow.

## Workflows

| File | Trigger | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `test_unreal_plugin.yml` | `workflow_call` / dispatch | Build the plugin via UBT against the host project + run UE Automation specs for ONE UE version; parse the exported `index.json` (authoritative, not the editor exit code). |
| `test_pull_request.yml` | PR | Calls the reusable test per UE version (matrix **5.6 / 5.7**) + an **E2E** job: `unreal-mcp-cli install-extension` → headless boot → `run-tool` per tool (`Tests/e2e`). |
| `release.yml` | push to `main` | **Version-gated** on the `.uplugin` `VersionName` bump + tag-not-exists → full tests → `BuildPlugin` per UE version → **atomic** GitHub Release with the plugin zips. |
| `bump_version.yml` | manual | Runs `commands/bump-version.ps1`, pushes `release/<v>`, opens a PR. |

## Self-hosted runner gating (never red-by-absence)

The UBT/Automation/E2E legs run on a **self-hosted Windows UE runner** (label
`[self-hosted, windows, unreal]`). They are gated so they **skip** — never fail a PR — until you
register a runner and set repository variables:

| Variable | Enables |
| --- | --- |
| `UNREAL_RUNNER_READY = true` | `test_unreal_plugin.yml` (UBT build + Automation) and `release.yml` build/test legs |
| `UNREAL_E2E_READY = true` | the E2E `install-extension` + tool-invocation job in `test_pull_request.yml` |
| `UNREAL_HOST_PROJECT` | absolute path on the runner to a host `.uproject` that has the **UnrealMCP core plugin** available (the Automation pass junctions this extension into its `Plugins/` and builds the host editor target) |

Fork PRs never run on the self-hosted runner (`head.repo.full_name == github.repository` guard); a
fork PR's checked-out code must not execute on your machine.

## The multi-UE-version matrix

`5.6 / 5.7` is the analog of Unity's multi-version test matrix. It both validates the extension on
each supported engine and ties directly to the **compile-on-install** per-version decision (the
release packages a `BuildPlugin` zip per UE version, which the installer picks from).

## E2E = a cross-dependency on the install layer

The E2E job consumes `unreal-mcp-cli install-extension` (the T1 install capability). In CI it
installs from the local checkout via `--source` (offline/CI escape hatch — mirrors `godot-cli`),
boots a headless editor, waits for `tools/list`, then runs `Tests/e2e/Run-ToolChecks.ps1`, which
calls `unreal-mcp-cli run-tool <tool>` per check and asserts a well-formed JSON success. If the CLI
command is not yet published when you enable E2E, this leg documents the contract the CLI must meet.
